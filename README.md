EnginuityIQ Website – Three Page HTML/CSS Project *FINAL*

This project contains the current version of my company (EnginuityIQ) website. The site includes three HTML5 pages one shared CSS file. In hind sight, I think it would have been better have one css per html page.

Pages Included are:

index.html — Homepage Displays the hero video placeholder, introductory text, partner logo strip, support section, business accolade cards, and the global site navigation. This page represents the primary landing experience for EnginuityIQ.

ai.html — Artificial Intelligence Page (Page 2) Introduces the Artificial Intelligence services offered by EnginuityIQ. It includes an intro section, three case study cards, and an “AI Impact” explanation block.

cyberrisk.html — CyberRisk Page (Page 3) Presents the Global Threat Report overview, Cybersecurity service grid (Gap Analysis, Endpoint, Next-Gen Pro, AI Detection, Response, SaaS, Data Pro, XIoT Response), a Defend Your Identity section and three case studies.

styles.css — Shared Stylesheet (this is goign to be too long by the time I get to the 10th page) Contains all visual formatting, layout styling, branding colors, Flexbox layouts, and consistent typography across the site.

Expected Outcome: When opened in a browser, the website displays a user-friendly three-page site with structured layout, responsive behavior at basic screen sizes, and clearly organized sections that follow the provided wireframes. Navigation links allow movement between pages, and all styling loads from a single CSS file.
